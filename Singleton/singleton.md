# Singleton Design Pattern

## Definition
The **Singleton Pattern** is a creational design pattern that restricts a class to a **single instance** while providing **global access** to that instance. It ensures that no additional instances can be created, making it useful for managing shared resources or centralized control systems.

---

## Core Principles
1. **Single Instance**: Only one instance of the class exists during the application's lifecycle.
2. **Controlled Access**: The instance is accessed through a dedicated method (e.g., `getInstance()`).
3. **Private Construction**: The class constructor is hidden to prevent external instantiation.
4. **Thread Safety**: Ensures safe initialization in multi-threaded environments (optional but common).

---

## Key Terminology
- **Creational Pattern**: A design pattern category focused on object creation.
- **Global Access Point**: A unified way to retrieve the singleton instance.
- **Lazy Initialization**: The instance is created only when first requested.
- **Eager Initialization**: The instance is created at application startup.
- **Double-Checked Locking**: A thread-safe optimization for lazy initialization.

## Related Concepts
1. **Global State**: Shared data accessible across an application (similar to singletons but less controlled).
2. **Dependency Injection**: An alternative to avoid tight coupling from singletons.
3. **Monostate Pattern**: Multiple instances share the same underlying state.
4. **Static Classes**: Classes with only static members (no instantiation, but lacks flexibility).

## Implementation Notes
### Common Strategies
- **Lazy Initialization**: Defers instance creation until needed.
- **Eager Initialization**: Instantiates the singleton upfront.
- **Thread-Safe Initialization**: Uses synchronization mechanisms for multi-threaded environments.

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- **Overuse**: Singletons can lead to hidden dependencies and tight coupling.
- **Testability Issues**: Global state complicates unit testing.
- **Serialization/Cloning Risks**: May accidentally create duplicate instances.

## Use Cases
1. **Resource Management**: Central control for databases, thread pools, or file systems.
2. **Configuration**: Single source for application settings.
3. **Logging**: Unified logging service across components.
4. **Caching**: Shared cache for performance optimization.

## Advantages and Disadvantages
| **Pros**                          | **Cons**                          |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Guarantees a single instance      | Introduces global state           |
| Efficient resource usage          | Harder to unit test               |
| Lazy initialization support       | Can violate SOLID principles      |
| Thread-safe variants available    | May encourage poor design practices |

- **Factory Method**: Creates objects without specifying exact classes.
- **Abstract Factory**: Produces families of related objects.
- **Prototype**: Clones objects instead of creating new instances.
